Hello! I’m a PhD student working with **[Ben Good](https://bgoodlab.github.io)** and **[Dmitri Petrov](https://petrovlab-stanford.squarespace.com)** in the Physics Department at Stanford University. I am interested in evolution from a quantitative perspective, with a focus on finding low-dimensional structure in genotype-phenotype-fitness maps, using yeast as a model system. You can find a list of my publications **[here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kxwLfygAAAAJ&hl=en)**, and a full CV **[here](https://omghosh.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_Ghosh.pdf)**.

In my PhD, I have also worked on gaining a theoretical understanding of evolutionary dynamics in the human gut microbiome, accounting for spatial structure, as well as longer term evolutionary dynamics from a collection of natural yeast isolates.

I previously studied Physics at Columbia University and researched 2D materials and nanoelectronics. I grew up in San Diego, California. Outside the lab, I enjoy running, ceramics, and walking aroud Golden Gate Park.
